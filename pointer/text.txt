Spring
Redbuds' blossom pink,
A touch of warmth from the brink,
Is the spark that makes two hearts link.
Summer
At Milky Way's end the wish comes true,
As I catch the meteor shower,
In my hands with you.
Autumn
When hazel shells are plumping,
And pumpkin gourds are swelling,
Trees fall in love, blushing.
Winter
A crystalline veil,
A blanket of clean pale,
Hides a sigh, a buried tale.
